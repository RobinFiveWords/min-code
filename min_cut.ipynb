Our main job is to identify those three wires. This is known as finding a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_cut\">minimum cut</a>.\n",

    "When a simple algorithm is needed, I often like to write it from scratch each time, using only built-ins and standard libraries. (Inspirations include the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/\">Advent of Code subreddit</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/norvig/pytudes#pytudes-index-of-jupyter-ipython-notebooks\">Peter Norvig</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6VSAsKAj98\">David Beazley</a>.) By the sixth or seventh time I wrote a breadth-first search, I did it without any conscious doubt about how I was doing it. But that was BFS.\n",

    "I read about maxflows and mincuts in Sedgewick's <a href=\"https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/\">Algorithms</a>. Their Java code for maxflow problems includes several classes but is quite general. Some classes contain many attributes and methods that I wouldn't need to solve Day 25. I wondered whether I could simplify Sedgewick's approach enough to rewrite it from scratch, in Python, and still get a decent night's sleep. My main problem was that I didn't really understand the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford%E2%80%93Fulkerson_algorithm\">Ford–Fulkerson algorithm</a>, and how to identify the residual network in Sedgewick's implementation so as to find a minimum cut. As of starting this project, I still don't.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, to collect the last of my 50 stars that night — disclaimer: it was January 30, not December 24 — I took a brute-force approach and eventually came up with a simplifying assumption that, although not guaranteed to produce the correct answer, did so in under ten seconds runtime. A few months later, I used <a href=\"https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/\">NetworkX</a> to write an almost trivial solution to the problem, letting the `minimum_edge_cut` and `connected_components` functions do the hard work. NetworkX seems pretty great, and there's probably no reason to avoid using it if I'm already working in Python.\n",

If we accept that our starting graph (network) has just one connected component — from any given vertex we can reach every other vertex — then we can test any potential solution by removing its three edges (wires) from the graph and rechecking whether, in this modified graph, from any given vertex we can reach every other vertex. To check the modified graph, we can arbitrarily pick a vertex and do a depth-first search, counting how many vertices we reach. If it is less than the total number of vertices, we have our solution.\n",

In other words, if for any given vertex I added up the shortest number of edges that would need to be traversed to reach each other vertex, the solution vertices would be among the vertices with the lowest sums.\n",

In the modified graph, let's say $X$ is in connected component $A$, and $Y$ is in connected component $B$. We still want to focus on the original, connected graph, but with each vertex belonging to either $A$ or $B$. Now let's consider all the vertices in $A$ other than $X$ for which $X{\\textendash}Y$ is the closest solution edge. For these vertices in $A$, their shortest path to reach any vertex in $B$ is through $X$, which means they are farther from every vertex in $B$ than $X$ is. If $X$ is closer to many other vertices than many others are, perhaps on average it is closer to _all_ other vertices than _most_ others are.\n",

    "It was clear to me that DFS or BFS would always identify an augmenting path, if one existed, using the original flow network — forward edges only — or, in other words, using remaining capacity without undoing any previous flows. But I didn't understand how the use of backward edges would work, as this would undo a previous flow. In the graph above, $A{\\rightarrow}D$ is a forward edge, and $D{\\rightarrow}A$ is a backward edge. The path $S{\\rightarrow}C{\\rightarrow}D{\\rightarrow}A{\\rightarrow}B{\\rightarrow}T$ removes 4 from $A{\\rightarrow}D$, and what I struggled to understand was how removing 4 here, and adding back that same 4 somewhere else, would result in a net increase instead of no net change.\n",
    "\n",
    "I finally realized that a new path using a backward edge is equivalent to the new path saying to the existing path, \"I've got this covered. From my own sources I can send into this vertex up to X of what you sent into this vertex. Take back as much of that X as you can, and try a different route. If any of it can reach the sink, we've found an augmenting path.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "I now realized that my first case is perhaps overly simple, because it can be solved without using any backward paths. Still, I drew the residual network for this network after the first three paths. Because a currently unused edge can be used in either direction — this is an undirected graph — the graph and the residual network include a forward edge in each direction, for any currently unused edge. I've represented unused edges with an arrow at both ends, but the picture would be clearer if I found a way to display two separate arrows, one pointing in either direction.\n",

There are four ways to continue from there, and each can produce an augmenting path. The \"I've got this\" approach makes me more comfortable with why that is so. For example, the augmenting path `qnr - nvd - lhk - cmg - rzs - lsr - frs` can be thought of as saying to `qnr - cmg - lhk - frs`, \"I've got `lhk - frs` covered. Change your path to `qnr - cmg - rzs - lsr - frs`. (And I'll be `qnr - nvd - lhk - frs`. And `cmg - lhk` will go back to being unused.)\""

    "I'm not sure how to describe this without using weights, so I'll use weights. Let's say edge $A \\textendash B$ has capacity 5, and in the current state $A{\\rightarrow}B$ has flow 2. I initially expected the residual network to show $A{\\rightarrow}B$ with capacity 3 (this is inarguably correct) and $B{\\rightarrow}A$ with capacity 2. But if the maxflow requires a positive flow $B{\\rightarrow}A$, that can't be accomplished with a single augmenting path if the residual network's capacity for $B{\\rightarrow}A$ is only enough to set the true flow back to zero. It makes more sense to me for the residual network's capacity for $B{\\rightarrow}A$ to be 7.\n",

    "<div align=\"center\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"img/20240831_1.png\"\n",
    "        alt=\"Minimal example with four vertices to demonstrate having to reverse a flow from an existing path; showing the initial undirected graph, first augmenting path, and residual graph.\" />\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Sidebar on backward edges involving source or sink: I don't think the residual network needs to show any capacity going back into the source or coming out of the sink, which is why I put the two zeros in the residual network graph. This feels intuitive to me, but I also have an explanation for it. The source has infinite capacity, even if the edges do not, so there's nothing to gain by telling the source to try a different route. The source already uses its infinite capacity to try different routes, to try to find augmenting paths. As for the sink, the goal is to flow into the sink. At that point there's nothing to gain by moving backward, because the flow can't do any better than having reached the sink.\n",
    "\n",
    "Back to the example: If the residual network's capacity for $B{\\rightarrow}A$ was limited to the used capacity on $A{\\rightarrow}B$ — 1 rather than 2 — it would take two more augmenting paths to arrive at the maximum flow. The first $S{\\rightarrow}B{\\rightarrow}A{\\rightarrow}T$ would add 1. Then I'd need to observe that $A{\\textendash}B$ was empty and add both $A{\\rightarrow}B$ and $B{\\rightarrow}A$ back to the residual network, each with capacity 1. Finally I could traverse $S{\\rightarrow}B{\\rightarrow}A{\\rightarrow}T$ again to add another 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the approach I'm thinking of is to ensure that, for any undirected edge $A{\\textendash}B$, in the residual network the sum of the capacities for $A{\\rightarrow}B$ and $B{\\rightarrow}A$ is constant at twice the capacity of $A{\\textendash}B$. If we add flow to $A{\\rightarrow}B$, we subtract that amount from the residual capacity of $A{\\rightarrow}B$ and add that amount to the residual capacity of $B{\\rightarrow}A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point I wondered how I would handle a case where a solution edge is not full. A little searching gave me the answer that the edges of a minimum cut will always be saturated, that this case doesn't exist. As I thought about it, it dawned on me that if I drew a graph to represent this case, and then found its actual minimum cut, the unsaturated edge that I had in mind would not actually be a solution edge."
